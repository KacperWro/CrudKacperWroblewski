# Kacper's PHP Discussion Forum CRUD Application
The theme for my CRUD application is a discussion forum. This is similar to Reddit and other similar sites where people can create posts in a specific category, and other users are able to comment on it.

### Instructions
* Open the XAMPP Control Panel on your machine and start 'Apache' and 'MySQL'
* Create a MySQL database called discussions_forum in PHP MyAdmin
* Copy and paste the SQL queries from the file titled 'discussions_forum.sql' to create tables and insert sample data into your newly created database
* Move the project folder files in to 'C:/xammp/htdocs' so Apache can process the PHP code in the project files
* Run index.php from Visual Studio Code or another IDE of your choice
* Enjoy the show!
